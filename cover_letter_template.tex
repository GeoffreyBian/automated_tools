Dear \companyname \ hiring manager,

\vspace{15pt}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the \nameofjob \ position at \companyname. With a strong background in computer engineering, a proven track record in both software and firmware roles, and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

\vspace{10pt}

In my current role as a Software Engineer Intern at Rivian Automotive, I have been developing customer-facing Body Control features in C, ensuring strict adherence to system requirements and implementing comprehensive testing procedures. My responsibilities include deploying unit tests with GoogleTest and automating Python testing scripts for Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) systems to achieve ASIL A, B, and C metrics. This role has honed my skills in system integration and vehicle firmware diagnostics, making me adept at working with cross-functional teams to uphold functional safety standards and optimize performance metrics.

\vspace{10pt}

Previously, as a Hardware Designer with UBC Formula Electric, I contributed to the development and validation of the Tractive System Active Light PCB board and played a key role in the construction of our electric vehicle, Quadruna. My work involved leveraging tools like ChimeraTool and Python scripts for PCB testing and validation, and our team's efforts led to significant achievements, including 2nd place in battery efficiency at the Formula SAE Electric competition 2023.

\vspace{10pt}

In my earlier role as a Mechanical Engineering Intern at Acuren, I conducted mechanical tests using industry-standard equipment, performed data analysis with Excel and Ansys Mechanical, and authored technical reports to support project recommendations and client communications. I analyzed datasets of over 5000 datapoints to identify root causes of material failures, deriving actionable insights and drawing meaningful conclusions.

\vspace{10pt}

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I have maintained a strong GPA of 4.1. My technical skill set is diverse and robust, encompassing proficiency in multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript. I am adept in various development tools and frameworks, including full-stack development environments, version control systems like Git, and Linux-based systems. My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in the principles of modern software development, enabling me to effectively tackle complex technical challenges.

\vspace{10pt}

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to \companyname. I am available for an 8-month term starting January 2025 and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs. Please feel free to contact me via email at \href{mailto:geoffreybian100@gmail.com}{geoffreybian100@gmail.com} or by phone at 604-352-3756.

\vspace{10pt}

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

\vspace{15pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{15pt}

Geoffrey Bian
